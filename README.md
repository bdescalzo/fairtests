# AI minimax Fairness testing framework

This project is a minimal framework for testing different SOTA fair learning algorithms, and comparing them against meta-learning approaches.

The project is built as part of an internship in the Intelligent Systems Group of the UPV/EHU, and aims to test whether MAML meta-learning (and derivatives) can compete in mini-max fairness against other fairness-aware methods.
